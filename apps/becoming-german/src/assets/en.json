The accuracy of the database relies on as many individual entries as possible being collected from various groups of society and regions in Germany. {$LINE_BREAK}{$LINE_BREAK} To achieve this I went on a walkabout through Germany with the purpose-built Mobile-Info-Module in the summer months of 2005. {$LINE_BREAK}{$LINE_BREAK} The database is currently only in German.{$LINE_BREAK}{$LINE_BREAK}",
