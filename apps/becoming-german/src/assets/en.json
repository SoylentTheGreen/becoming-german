The childhood memories which are \"received\" are compiled from the data which has been \"donated\" and represent memories of a possible German childhood which can then be appropriated as one's own. {$LINE_BREAK} The more data entries in the database the more accurate the \"received\" German childhoods can become. The accuracy of the database relies on as many individual entries as possible being collected from various groups of society and regions in Germany. {$LINE_BREAK}{$LINE_BREAK} To achieve this I went on a walkabout through Germany with the purpose-built Mobile-Info-Module in the summer months of 2005. {$LINE_BREAK}{$LINE_BREAK} The database is currently only in German.{$LINE_BREAK}{$LINE_BREAK}",

This consists of a light wooden trolley with a built-in folding table and two folding stools. Carried in a Becoming German Travel Bag a laptop with the database installed on the local hard drive is used to collect data on the road. Data collected in this way is later uploaded onto the live internet database with a specially developed synchronisation software tool. {$LINE_BREAK}{$LINE_BREAK} During the summer months of 2005 I travelled through many parts of Germany with the Mobile-Info-Module and approached people on the street asking them to tell me about their childhood. This enabled a direct exchange between the storyteller and listener in the tradition of oral history. {$LINE_BREAK}{$LINE_BREAK} Both past and future stations of the journey are listed under {$START_LINK}Stations{$CLOSE_LINK}.",
